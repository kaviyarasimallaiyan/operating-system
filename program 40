In Linux, file access permissions are used to control the level of access that different users have to a file.
There are three types of permissions: read (r), write (w), and execute (x). 
These permissions can be assigned to three different types of users: the owner of the file, the group that the owner belongs to, and others (everyone else).

Owner: The owner of a file has the most control over the file and can set the permissions for the file. By default, the owner of a file is the user who created the file.

Group: The group is a collection of users who share common permissions. By default, the group of a file is the group that the owner of the file belongs to.

Others: This includes all other users who do not belong to the group or who are not the owner of the file.

To view the file access permissions in Linux, you can use the "ls -l" command in the terminal.
The permissions for each file are listed in the first column, with the letters "rwx" representing the read, write, and execute permissions for each user type.
For example, "rwxr-xr-x" means that the owner has read, write, and execute permissions, the group has read and execute permissions, and others have read and execute permissions.
